# Emotions Classification Using LSTM & Machine Learning

This project aims to classify emotions in text data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing text samples labeled with different emotions such as anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

# Background

Understanding emotions expressed in text can be valuable in various applications such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and social media monitoring. This project utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for text classification tasks.

# Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/NishitPatel25/Emotion-Classification-using-LSTM-and-ML

Install the required dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use the provided scripts and notebooks for various tasks:

train_model.py: Train the emotion classification model.
evaluate_model.py: Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
predict_emotion.py: Predict the emotion of new text samples using the trained model.
emotion_classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploring data, training, and evaluating the model.
# Data
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of text samples labeled with corresponding emotions. It is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

# Model Architecture
The emotion classification model employs an LSTM-based neural network with multiple layers. The input is preprocessed text data converted into word embeddings. The model learns to classify emotions based on the learned representations of words and their sequential context.

# Training
During training, the model optimizes its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rates are tuned to achieve optimal performance.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set. Additionally, confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to analyze the model's predictions across different emotions.

# Results
The trained model achieves a high accuracy rate on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify emotions accurately in text data. Results are visualized and analyzed to gain insights into the model's strengths and potential areas for improvement.
